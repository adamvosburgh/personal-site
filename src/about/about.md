Currently I am the Associate Director of the [MS Computational Design Practices](https://www.arch.columbia.edu/programs/15-m-s-computational-design-practices) program, and an Adjunct Assistant Professor at Columbia's Graduate School of Architecture Planning and Preservation. <br> <br>

If you ask me what my discipline is, I would probably say that I am a designer that works with technology a lot. More specifically, I would say my research practice focuses around simulation as a form of representation, and the critical use of geospatial data to describe the built environment. <br> <br>

I received my Master of Architecture h from Columbia GSAPP with the Honor Award for Design and Visualization, and my B.A. in Architecture and Japanese language studies from UNC Charlotte. <br> <br>

I used to work as an architect, at SANAA in Tokyo, and Office for Metropolitan Architecture in New York. <br> <br>
