I built this tool after moving into a new apartment and needing storage – entry cabinets, media consoles, nightstands, a mix of open and closed shelving. I wanted to upgrade from my previous IKEA pieces – mainly in material – while keeping their functionality, modularity, and affordability. The Kallax system turned out to be the perfect starting point. I recreated its internal module using plywood, built 13 custom pieces for my space, and refined a repeatable, cohesive design logic along the way.

In Rhino, I developed a flexible block system that could scale from one piece to many. Afterwards, I turned that into this web app – a way to share the design logic of furniture construction while preserving the Kallax’s interior module. This tool lets you make plywood furniture that’s *compatible with IKEA Kallax accessories*, merge or resize modules (taller, wider, deeper, shallower), and customize doors, backs, and proportions. For reference: all my own builds are 16" deep (to match what I planned to place on top) and use 1/2" doors – which work fine structurally, but are too shallow for a standard Euro hinge. I made this for fun and hope others find it useful. If you make something with it, please share! You can reach me by email with builds, issues, or suggestions – I’ll do my best to reply.
