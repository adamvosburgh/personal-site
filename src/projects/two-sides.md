Data Visualization completed for the 2025 Milan Triennale, within the exhibition “We the Bacteria. Notes Toward Biotic Architecture”, curated by Mark Wigley and Beatriz Colomina, as part of a broader inquiry into the historical and ongoing entanglements between microbial life and architecture.

Our work is a data visualization that explores the interdependent relationship between humans, bacteria, and the built environment. The front side of the coin—titled Biomes—features a phylogenetic tree of bacteria identified in samples from individuals across a spectrum of lifestyles, ranging from indigenous communities to those in highly urbanized settings. The reverse side—Anthromes—traces changes in anthropogenic land use from 1000 BCE to 2017 CE, revealing how human activity has reshaped ecological systems over millennia.

**Project Text**

It’s no surprise that the last 12,000 years of human history have taken a dramatic toll on the planet. But something similar has been happening inside the human body – the wilderness within us has also become markedly more homogenous.  
 
The front of the disk visualizes the largest dataset of such microbes ever assembled. It shows an evolutionary tree of these microbes, comprising more than 150,000 unique genetic sequences  grouped into almost 5,000 tree elements. The oldest microbe in the human microbiome is at the center of the spiral.
 
The back of the disk visualizes a model of 12,000 years of human activity. It shows that almost three-quarters of terrestrial nature has long been shaped, in very different ways, by people. The crisis of biodiversity does not stem from human habitation and use as such, but from the intensifying appropriation, exploitation, and urbanization of the planet we live on.

As urbanization accelerates, biodiversity shrinks within and without.
