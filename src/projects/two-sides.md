Data Visualization completed for the 2025 Milan Triennale, within the exhibition “We the Bacteria. Notes Toward Biotic Architecture”, curated by Mark Wigley and Beatriz Colomina, as part of a broader inquiry into the historical and ongoing entanglements between microbial life and architecture.

Our work is a data visualization that explores the interdependent relationship between humans, bacteria, and the built environment. The front side of the coin—titled Biomes—features a phylogenetic tree of bacteria identified in samples from individuals across a spectrum of lifestyles, ranging from indigenous communities to those in highly urbanized settings. The reverse side—Anthromes—traces changes in anthropogenic land use from 1000 BCE to 2017 CE, revealing how human activity has reshaped ecological systems over millennia.
