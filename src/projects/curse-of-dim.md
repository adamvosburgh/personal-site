## Project Description

It’s no surprise that the last 12,000 years of human history have taken a dramatic toll on the planet. But something similar has been happening inside the human body – the wilderness within us has also become markedly more homogenous.  
 
The front of the disk visualizes the largest dataset of such microbes ever assembled. It shows an evolutionary tree of these microbes, comprising more than 150,000 unique genetic sequences  grouped into almost 5,000 tree elements. The oldest microbe in the human microbiome is at the center of the spiral.
 
The back of the disk visualizes a model of 12,000 years of human activity. It shows that almost three-quarters of terrestrial nature has long been shaped, in very different ways, by people. The crisis of biodiversity does not stem from human habitation and use as such, but from the intensifying appropriation, exploitation, and urbanization of the planet we live on.


As urbanization accelerates, biodiversity shrinks within and without.
