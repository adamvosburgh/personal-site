This projected was completed for the the 19th International Architecture Exhibition, titled Intelligens. Natural. Artificial. Collective., curated by Carlo Ratti and organised by La Biennale di Venezia. It took the form of a short data-visualization film, with a mix of real and simulated datasets. It sat within *Artificial* section of the Arsenale, and is on view until November 23rd, 2025.

The Curse of Dimensionality explores predictive models of risk — computational models, built from Artificial Intelligence and machine learning methods —  that assess different kinds of threats present in both physical and virtual spaces. These predictive tools are deployed by governments, corporations, and civil society, and, in the name of safety and security, strike an unstable balance between protection and harm. The Curse of Dimensionality spotlights the ways that algorithmic systems, reliant on vast troves of data, translate people and places into the language of risk, an abstraction that can inadvertently justify conflict and exacerbate existing disparities. Through simulations, the project draws attention to these overlooked junctures of power. The aim is to train the senses of the audience to see, hear, and confront the hidden complexities at the heart of this threat analysis — explaining those subtle, often invisible factors that increasingly shape conflict around the world.

In technical terms, the “curse of dimensionality” names a problem of scaling — as the number of features (dimensions) in training data increases, models require exponentially more data to be accurate, and interpretability is often sacrificed. These ideas are unpacked across three related algorithms visualized in an animation.
